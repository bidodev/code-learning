        <strong>Counter-Strike (CS)</strong>
        is a series of multiplayer first-person shooter video games, in which
        teams of terrorists battle to perpetrate an act of terror (bombing,
        hostage-taking, assassination) and counter-terrorists try to prevent it
        (bomb defusal, hostage rescue). The series began on Windows in 1999 with
        the first game, Counter-Strike. It was initially released as a
        modification ("mod") for Half-Life and designed by Minh "Gooseman" Le
        and Jess "Cliffe" Cliffe before the rights to the game's intellectual
        property were acquired by Valve, the developers of Half-Life.

        That original game was followed by Counter-Strike: Condition Zero,
        developed by Turtle Rock Studios and released in 2004. In November of
        that year, Counter-Strike: Source was released by Valve. Released eight
        months after Condition Zero, Source was a remake of the original
        Counter-Strike and the first in the series to run on Valve's newly
        created Source engine.[4] The fourth game in the main series,
        Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, was released by Valve in 2012 for
        Windows, OS X, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3. Hidden Path Entertainment,
        who worked on Counter-Strike: Source post-release, helped to develop the
        game alongside Valve.[5]
