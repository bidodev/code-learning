# Test - Programming Basics

## Test Instructions

- Work from the `index.js` file provided in this repository.
- Follow all of the instructions below to complete the test.
- **Important**: Make sure that the names of your variables/functions match the names in the instructions below.
- Print solutions to the console where specified.
- Make sure to commit and push your test.
- Good luck üçÄ

### Data Structure

#### Objects

##### 1. Key Pair Values

- Create an object called "profileData". Add four key pair values to the object: name, surname, age and city.

##### 2. Object to Array

- Convert an object into a nested array of key pair values. Look the example below.

**Given Object**

```javascript
myObj = {
  "1": 10,
  "2": 20,
  "3": 30
};
```

**Expected Output**:

```javascript
[
  ["1", 10],
  ["2", 20],
  ["3", 30]
];
```

#### Arrays

##### 1. Data Manipulation

- Create a function named "_convertArrayData_". Use array methods to manipulate the data the array below. The first two items in the array should switch positions and the third item should be replaced by a new item. Change the data to get the result below. Print your solution to the console.

**Original Array**

```javascript
["coffee", "tea", "juice"];
```

**Expected output**

```javascript
["tea", "coffee", "milk"];
```

##### 2. Create Grid (Optional)

- Create a function called "createGrid", which returns a grid of a 2D array by accepting two arguments: `size` (which determines the number of nested arrays and the number of elements in each nested array) and `char` (which determines the characters in each nested array). Print your solution to the console.

**Create Grid Function Call**

```javascript
createGrid(3, "*");
```

**Expected Output**

```javascript
[
  ["*", "*", "*"],
  ["*", "*", "*"],
  ["*", "*", "*"]
];
```

##### 3. Word Converter

- Given an array of words, create a function named "_wordConverter_" which uses an array method to add _"er"_ to the end of each string in the array. Look at the expected output below. **Important**: Do **not** use a loop to complete this task. Print your solution to the console.

**Array of words**

```javascript
["smart", "kind", "sweet", "small", "clear"];
```

**Expected output**

```javascript
["smarter", "kinder", "sweeter", "smaller", "clearer"];
```

##### 4. Hour Calculation

- Create a function called "_calculateHours_" which calculate how many hours (total) this person worked in the week based on the data structure `hourTracking` below. **Note**: start is always morning time, end is always afternoon. Print your solution to the console.

**Working Hours**

```javascript
const hourTracking = [
  { day: "Monday", start: 8, end: 17 },
  { day: "Tuesday", start: 9, end: 15 },
  { day: "Wednesday", start: 10, end: 18 },
  { day: "Thursday", start: 7, end: 14 },
  { day: "Friday", start: 6, end: 12 }
];
```

**Expected Output**

```javascript
36;
```

#### Classes

- Create a blueprint for a course at DCI - using the `class` syntax in javascript. The class should be named "Course" The class should contain who the teacher is, whether the group is learning marketing or web development and the number of students taking the course.
- The class should also have a method named "spaceNeeded" that checks how big a classroom should be depending on the number of students taking the course: 1 student = 2m¬≤. E.g. If a course has 10 students, then print: "_The classroom should be 20m¬≤._". Print your solution to the console.
- Create a method named "details" to print all the information of the course: "This is a web development course taught by Ali. There are 10 students taking the course.\_". Print your solution to the console.
- **Note**: Please use the phrases found in the instructions above and just change the output depending on the teacher, course, number of students etc.

**Expected Output**

```javascript
course.spaceNeeded();
`The classroom should be 44m¬≤.`;

course.details();
`This is a web development course taught by Ali. There are 22 students taking the course.`;
```

#### Problem Solving

##### 1. Format your string

- Write function named "_capitalizeFirstLetter_" that accepts a string as an argument. The function should convert the first character of each word to uppercase. **Example** _the quick brown fox_ ‚Üí _The Quick Brown Fox_. Print your solution to the console.

**Expected Output**

```javascript
capitalizeFirstLetter("hey there"); ‚Üí `Hey There`
```

##### 2. Validation

- Look at the unit tests for validating a pin. Create a function named "_validPin_" that fulfills the requirements of the tests.

**Requirements**:

- The pin code must consist of only numbers.
- The pin code must be 4 digits long.
- The pin should have at least **two** different digits.
- The pin code's last digit should be even.
- The pin code should add up to at least 5.

The function should print `true` if the pin meets all the requirements and `false` if it does not. Print your solution to the console.

**Expected Output**

```javascript
validPin("1234"); ‚Üí true

validPin("1235"); ‚Üí false // last number should be even

validPin("wwww"); ‚Üí false // should only consist of numbers

validPin("12345"); ‚Üí false // should be 4 digits, not 5

validPin("2222"); ‚Üí false // should have at least 2 different digits

validPin("1000"); ‚Üí false // does not add up to at least 5

validPin("2224"); ‚Üí true
```
